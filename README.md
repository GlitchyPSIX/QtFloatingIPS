## How to Install (on Linux)
### Snap

Install Qt Floating IPS in seconds on [Ubuntu and other snap supported Linux 
distributions](https://snapcraft.io/docs/core/install) with:

    snap install qtfloatingips

### Building From Source
First clone the repository using `git`, if you don't have `git` installed
you can find installation instructions [here](https://git-scm.com)

```
$ git clone https://github.com/covarianttensor/QtFloatingIPS.git
```

Now we need to install the qt5 development libraries and tools, the
commands for various platforms are listed below:

*Fedora*
```
# dnf install qt5-devel make gcc gcc-c++
```

*Debian and Ubuntu*
```
# apt install qtdeclarative5-dev qt5-default build-essential
```

You should then have access to `qmake`, `make`, and the qt5 development
libraries. Next `cd` into the project folder inside the repo:

```
$ cd QtFloatingIPS/QtFloatingIPS
```

You can specify the target directory using the `PREFIX` `qmake` variable (default: `/usr/local`).
Now run `qmake`, this will auto generate a makefile:

```
$ qmake PREFIX=/usr
```

or on Fedora:

```
$ qmake-qt5 PREFIX=/usr
```

Then run `make` to build the project:

```
$ make
```

And finally run `make install` to install the app:

```
# make install
```

Now you're good to go!

## How to Install (on OS X)
Compiled binaries for OS X are available. Download from the releases page (link below), then unzip and just drag and drop into your Applications folder.

### OS X Releases
+ OS X binaries can be found [here](https://github.com/covarianttensor/Flips/releases/tag/1.0).
---

### Building From Source
First clone the repository using `git`, if you don't have `git` installed
you can find installation instructions [here](https://git-scm.com).

However, it is **strongly recommended** that you can install `git` as part of the `Xcode Command Line Tools`,
because you will need the command line tools to use the `brew` package manager.
More information about `Xcode` can be found [here](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

```
$ git clone https://github.com/covarianttensor/QtFloatingIPS.git
```

Next we need to make sure we have `brew` installed for OS X. If you don't
already have `brew` installed you can find installation instructions [here](https://brew.sh/).

Now we need to install the qt5 development libraries and tools, the
command for `brew` is listed below:

```
# brew install qt
```

You should then have access to `qmake`, `make`, and the qt5 development
libraries. Next `cd` into the project folder inside the repo:

```
$ cd QtFloatingIPS/QtFloatingIPS
```

You can specify the target directory using the `PREFIX` `qmake` variable (default: `/usr/local`).
Now run `qmake`, this will auto generate a makefile:

```
$ qmake PREFIX=/usr
```

Then run `make` to build the project:

```
$ make
```

And finally run `make install` to install the app:

```
# make install
```

Now you're good to go!
